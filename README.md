# taskinator
Just a simple app bootstrapped using `create-react-app` where you can only add a task or delete all of them. No redux was used in this app since it's still pretty complicated for me to understand by the time I made this.

It also uses the `localStorage` API to persist tasks.

## Available Scripts

You can always use the available scripts provided by `create-react-app`.

`npm start` would be the most commonly used script in this project.
